Proposal :

We are planning to apply a set of learning algorithms. The current list of algorithms that we are planning to evaluate include the following.
• A Naive-Bayesian Learner
• A Decision Tree
• A Bayes Net
• A Neural Network
We will expand this list, time permitting. 
On top of this list, we intend to perform feature selection.
Finally, we will attempt to create ensembles to improve predictive accuracy.

3 Comparison and Evaluation
1. Plot PR and/or RoC curves for each of the models obtained above.
2. We are also interested in evaluating the models represented by the neural net and the Bayes net and examining correlations between the two.
3. We will evaluate our feature selection and ensembles relative to the baselines established in step 1.

Discussion :

Base Learners -
	NB - done?
	Decision Tree - works in R, does it work in python too?
	NN - atleast 1 NN works in R .. reduce training set size, or use more powerful machine
	Bayes Net - ?
	Neural Network / SVM - ?
	Ensemble - to do
Feature Engineering  - sort of done
Feature Selection - do separately ? 
	Normalization of features?
Evaluation
	PR	- does the function we found take any data frame in appropriate format?
	ROC - is there a similar function?


for each learner, we should call scripts multiple times with appropriately added / removed features, etc.
